        <h1 style="margin: 8px; color: brown;">WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF COMMUNITY</h1>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizens are given an independent venue to voice concerns.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizen-led oversight gives police departments an independent line of sight into officer
            misconduct and provides a venue for holding officers accountable.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizen-led oversight boards can help improve the quality of the department’s internal
            investigations of alleged misconduct by serving as a supplemental resource on police misconduct
            and an independent body for developing recommendations on departmental policy based on misconduct
            complaints.

        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizen-led oversight can help increase the public’s understanding of the Department’s policies and procedures.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizen-led oversight agencies can improve Department al operations by making policy
            policy recommendations stemming from citizen complaints regarding misconduct that identify
            areas of concern and subsequently offer recommendations to improve policing
        </p>

        <br>

        <p style="margin: 8px; color: black;">
            •Citizen-led oversight can assist a jurisdiction in liability management and reduce the likelihood
            of costly litigation by identifying problems and proposing non binding corrective measures before a
            lawsuit is filed.
