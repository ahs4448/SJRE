        <p>Birmingham is rich in historic and heritage legacies. Cultural preservation is the deliberate act of maintaining cultural heritage from the past to benefit from the past to benefit
            present and future generations. Cultural preservation is significant not only to Birmingham but indeed to the world. What happened in Birmingham changed the course of the nation in granting civil and human rights to all citizens of the
            United States. We owe it to future generations to preserve the stories and places that chronicle the civil rights movement.
